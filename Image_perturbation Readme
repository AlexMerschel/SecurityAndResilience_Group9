Please carefully go through this file before executing the code of AlterImg.py

On successful execution of this program you can see a GUI which has 7 different operation that can be applied to an image.
1. Grayscale
2. Rotate
3. Blur
4. Distort
5. Ripple
6. Salt & Pepper (Gaussian)
7. One Pixel Attack
This GUI acceps the parameter from the user and also contains the sample parameter which
apply's the amount of perturbation to be performed on an image to the selected operation.

The options on BLUE checkbox represents that the operation cannot be combined with other operations like (Grayscale,Rotate,Blur,Distort)
However operation in non BLUE color can be combined to perform the operation simultaneously.

Eg.. If an image needs to be perturbated with Grayscale, Rotate, Blur, Distort then all the four checkbox can be selected at the same time and
the resultant image will be stored in "Output" folder inside transformed directory with all the four operations performed.
But you cannot combine operation in BLUE color with others. IF combined only the BLUE colored checkbox operation will be performed
and stored in respective operation folder inside Transformed directory.

The GUI is designed to accept 'n' number of images within the folder. Therefore you will be asked to choose the folder that contains the images
when you press the process button .

NOTE: The input folder should only contain images and not other files or folder. If anything is present then application will result in exception
and does not move further.
