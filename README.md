Project number 1:  Adversarial examples for deep neural networks.

Goal: The aim of the project is to alter pixel values in images and find a threshold value that if surpassed makes a previously developed deep neural network
falsely classify the image. The deep neural network (DNN) will also be developed
by the group, and the project will work with images from the German Traffic
Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) data set.
